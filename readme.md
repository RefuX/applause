# Overview

Applause is a domain-specific language and a set of code-generators to produce mobile applications for iPhone, Android, Windows Phone and a mobile website on top of Google App Engine. It comes with IDE supports such as error checking, content assist and integrates into Eclipse.

Applause is not a web framework, a cross-compiler nor is it an interpreter. Instead, it uses a simple input language explicitily designed for data-driven mobile applications to produce human-readable source code in Objective-C, Java, C# or Python.

Have a look at this [short screencast](http://vimeo.com/15018235) to see it in action.

### Please Note

Even though you can build simple mobile applications with this open-source version of Applause, the code you are looking at is far from being a real product ;)
